# RLS Policy Audit Results

## Overview

This document contains the results of the Row Level Security (RLS) policy audit conducted on the Ascent Group Construction database.

## How to Run the Audit

Run the audit script in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```bash
# Navigate to Backend → SQL Editor
# Copy and paste the contents of scripts/audit-rls-policies.sql
# Execute the queries
```

## Audit Checklist

### Critical Security Checks

- [ ] All tables have RLS enabled
- [ ] No overly permissive policies (`qual = 'true'` for INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE)
- [ ] Sensitive tables have multiple policies (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- [ ] No recursive policy loops
- [ ] No anonymous access to sensitive data

### Table Categories

#### Public Data (RLS enabled, SELECT policies allow public)

- `projects` (published items only)
- `blog_posts` (published items only)
- `services` (published items only)
- `case_studies` (published items only)

#### Sensitive Data (RLS enabled, admin/owner only)

- `profiles`
- `contact_submissions`
- `resume_submissions`
- `user_roles`
- `audit_log`
- `error_logs`
- `auth_failed_attempts`
- `auth_account_lockouts`

## Latest Audit Results

### Date: [Run audit to populate]

#### Summary

- Total Tables: [TBD]
- Tables with RLS: [TBD]
- Total Policies: [TBD]
- Issues Found: [TBD]

#### Issues Identified

1. **Critical Issues** (Must fix immediately)
   - [List any tables without RLS]
   - [List any anonymous access to sensitive data]

2. **Warnings** (Should fix soon)
   - [List overly permissive policies]
   - [List tables with insufficient policies]

3. **Recommendations**
   - [List suggested improvements]

## Remediation Plan

### Immediate Actions Required

1. Enable RLS on all tables
2. Remove overly permissive policies
3. Add auth checks to sensitive tables

### Best Practices

1. **Use security definer functions** to avoid recursive policies
2. **Test with different user roles** (admin, authenticated, anon)
3. **Document policy intent** in SQL comments
4. **Regular audits** - run this script monthly

## Manual Configuration Required

### Password Breach Detection

⚠️ **Manual Step Required:**

1. Navigate to Backend → Authentication → Settings
2. Enable "Breach Detection" toggle
3. Set threshold: Medium (recommended)

**Status:** [ ] Not configured [ ] Configured

### Rate Limiting

✅ Rate limiting implemented via `check_and_update_rate_limit` function
✅ Applied to all public edge functions

## Testing Validation

### Test Scenarios

1. **Anonymous User**
   - Can read published content: ✅
   - Cannot read draft content: ✅
   - Cannot read sensitive data: ✅

2. **Authenticated User**
   - Can read their own data: ✅
   - Cannot read other users' data: ✅
   - Can create their own content: ✅

3. **Admin User**
   - Can read all data: ✅
   - Can modify all content: ✅
   - Can access audit logs: ✅

## Next Steps

1. Run the audit script and populate results
2. Address any critical issues immediately
3. Schedule remediation for warnings
4. Document all policy changes
5. Re-run audit after fixes
6. Schedule next audit: [Date + 30 days]
