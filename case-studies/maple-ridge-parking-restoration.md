# Maple Ridge Underground Parking Restoration - Mississauga

## Project Details
- **Client:** Maple Ridge Condominiums
- **Location:** Mississauga, ON
- **Category:** Parking Garage Restoration
- **Size:** 85,000 sq ft
- **Value:** $683,400
- **Duration:** 14 weeks (completed 2 weeks early)
- **Your Role:** Prime Contractor

## The Challenge

Maple Ridge Condominiums' underground parking garage was deteriorating rapidly. The 45-year-old, 85,000 sq ft facility showed extensive concrete spalling, exposed rebar corrosion, and compromised waterproofing.

### Primary Issues:
- **Concrete Degradation:** 40% of parking deck showed spalling, with rebar exposed in high-traffic areas
- **Water Infiltration:** Leaks from above-grade plaza caused pooling and freeze-thaw damage
- **Safety Hazards:** Falling concrete posed liability risks

### Constraints:
- 4-month window before winter
- $680K budget cap
- 200-vehicle garage must stay operational
- Limited 7'2" overhead clearance

### Client Goals:
1. Eliminate safety hazards within 60 days
2. Complete for under $700K
3. 10-year structural warranty
4. Minimize resident disruption

## Our Solution

### Phase 1: Forensic Assessment (Week 1-2)
- Mapped 2,847 spall locations using laser scanning
- Tested 45 core samples for chloride content
- Created 3D deterioration model
- **Value engineering saved $180K** by targeting high-chloride zones

### Phase 2: Structural Repairs (Week 3-8)
- 12,400 sq ft full-depth concrete replacement
- 8,600 sq ft overhead repairs
- 3,200 linear feet rebar replacement
- Used rapid-set materials (vehicles back in 12 hours)
- Maintained 78% parking availability

### Phase 3: Waterproofing (Week 9-12)
- 48,000 sq ft epoxy sealer
- 14,200 sq ft traffic-bearing membrane
- LED lighting upgrade

### Cost Savings:
- Targeted repairs vs blanket approach: **$180K saved**
- Direct material sourcing: **$42K saved**
- Rapid-set products (3 weeks faster): **$35K saved**
- In-house lighting: **$12K saved**
- **Total: $683,400** (0.5% over budget)

## The Results

### Outcomes:
✅ **14 weeks** (2 weeks early)
✅ **$683,400** (0.5% over budget - approved)
✅ **Zero safety incidents** (2,840 worker-hours)
✅ **5,200 PSI** concrete strength (vs 4,000 required)
✅ **10-year structural** + 15-year waterproofing warranty

### Impact:
- **$60K annual water damage eliminated**
- **$2.1M property value increase**
- **Complaints: 45/month → 2/month**
- **$18K/year insurance savings**

### Testimonial:
> "Ascent Group delivered beyond our expectations. They took a problem that had three other contractors quoting $850K-$1.2M and found a way to do it properly for $683K. It's been 18 months and we haven't had a single leak. Best contractor decision we've made in 20 years."
