      "A specialty contractor focuses exclusively on specific trades—in our case, building envelope and restoration work. Unlike general contractors who coordinate multiple subcontractors across various building systems, we self-perform the critical work with our own trained crews.",
      "For building envelope and restoration projects, this specialization matters. These aren't simple construction tasks—they require deep technical knowledge of building science, moisture management, structural integration, and material compatibility. A general contractor may understand how buildings go together, but a specialty contractor like Ascent lives and breathes façade systems, waterproofing, and envelope performance.",
      "The general contractor model creates hidden costs: multiple markup layers, coordination delays between subs, finger-pointing when problems arise, and inconsistent quality from rotating subcontractors. With a specialty contractor, you get single-source accountability, direct control over quality, and crews who have worked together for years perfecting their craft."

  faqs: [
    {
      question: "Aren't specialty contractors more expensive?",
      answer: "Actually, specialty contractors typically cost 20-35% less than the general contractor model for equivalent scope. Here's why: When you hire a general contractor for envelope work, you're paying their markup (15-25%), then paying the subcontractor's markup (15-20%), and getting the subcontractor's lowest bid. With a specialty contractor like Ascent, there's one markup and 85% of your budget goes directly into skilled labor and quality materials. You're paying less for better work performed by a company with expertise and warranty backing, not the lowest bidding subcontractor."
    },
    {
      question: "Can specialty contractors handle large projects?",
      answer: "Absolutely. Ascent manages projects ranging from $100K emergency repairs to $50M+ multi-year capital programs. Our specialty focus makes us more capable on large envelope projects, not less. We have dedicated estimating, project management, engineering, and field supervision teams—plus the crew capacity to self-perform at scale. Many general contractors actually prefer working with us on large projects specifically because we bring capability, consistency, and accountability they can't get from juggling multiple envelope subcontractors."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I need multiple building systems repaired?",
      answer: "For projects requiring work beyond the building envelope, we collaborate seamlessly with other trades. The key difference: we're directly performing the specialized envelope work (façade, waterproofing, masonry, parking structures) rather than marking up and coordinating subs. For mechanical, electrical, or interior work, we can coordinate other qualified trades—but for the envelope scope, you get our crews, our expertise, and our warranty. Many clients prefer this model: specialty contractors for specialized scope, direct relationships for accountability."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you work with architects and engineers?",
      answer: "Extensively. We work with building envelope consultants, structural engineers, and architects on nearly every project. Having in-house P.Eng capabilities and BCIN-certified designers means we speak the same language and can contribute technical input during design. We also perform design-build where we collaborate with consulting engineers to develop practical, constructible solutions. Our specialty expertise makes us better partners for design professionals—we understand building science, can identify constructibility issues early, and ensure designs translate to quality installation."
    },
    {
      question: "What makes building envelope work require specialization?",
      answer: "Building envelopes are complex hygrothermal systems managing heat, air, and moisture flow while supporting structural and aesthetic requirements. Proper envelope work requires understanding building science, material compatibility, structural integration, moisture management, thermal performance, and long-term durability. It's not carpentry or general construction—it's a specialized discipline. Poor envelope work is the #1 cause of building failures, lawsuits, and premature deterioration. That's why building codes now require specialized certifications and why insurance companies increasingly require envelope specialists on high-risk projects."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I know if my project needs a specialty contractor?",
      answer: "Consider a specialty contractor when: (1) The project is primarily envelope scope (façade, waterproofing, masonry, parking structures), (2) You need warranty backing and long-term accountability, (3) Technical expertise matters (complex repairs, investigations, heritage work), (4) Schedule reliability is critical, (5) You're managing a building portfolio and want consistency, or (6) Previous general contractor work has failed. If your building's envelope is the problem, don't hire a generalist—hire someone who lives and breathes envelope systems every day."
