    {
      question: "What was the biggest challenge renovating an occupied Toronto office building?",

  "waterfront-condo-exterior": [
    {
      question: "Why is exterior maintenance critical for waterfront condos in Toronto?",
      answer: "Toronto waterfront properties face accelerated deterioration from wind-driven rain, freeze-thaw cycles, and humidity.

  "heritage-building-restoration": [
    {
      question: "Do you work with Toronto's Heritage Committee for restoration projects?",

    },
    {
      question: "Can you improve energy efficiency while maintaining heritage appearance?",
      answer: "Yes. We use modern materials and techniques that replicate historical appearance while providing improved insulation, moisture protection, and durability. Many heritage building owners in the GTA see 20-30% energy savings after our restoration work."

  "retail-plaza-refresh": [
    {
      question: "How do you minimize disruption to retail tenants during renovations?",

    },
    {
      question: "What's the typical timeline for a retail plaza exterior refresh?",
      answer: "A standard retail plaza exterior refresh takes 6-10 weeks, depending on building size and scope. We work in sections to maintain tenant access and parking availability. Weather delays are factored into our GTA project timelines."

  ],
  "parking-garage-restoration": [
    {
      question: "Why are parking garage repairs so expensive?",
      answer: "Parking garage restoration requires specialized concrete repair, waterproofing systems, structural engineering, and traffic coating systems. Toronto's de-icing salt accelerates deterioration, requiring comprehensive solutions. Proactive maintenance is far more cost-effective than emergency structural repairs."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you keep parking garages operational during restoration?",
      answer: "We work in phases, typically closing one level or section at a time while maintaining access to remaining areas. For smaller garages, we may work overnight or on weekends. Coordination with property managers ensures minimal impact to Toronto and Mississauga tenants."
    },
    {
      question: "How often should parking garages be restored in the GTA?",
      answer: "GTA parking garages benefit from minor repairs every 3-5 years and comprehensive restoration every 10-15 years. Annual inspections identify small problems before they become expensive structural issues. We provide maintenance plans for properties throughout Toronto and Mississauga."

  "school-interior-painting": [
    {
      question: "What makes school painting different from other commercial projects?",
      answer: "Schools require low-VOC, antimicrobial paints for air quality and hygiene. We schedule work during school breaks (summer, holidays) to avoid disrupting students. Safety protocols are heightened, and we coordinate closely with school boards across Toronto and Mississauga."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to paint a school in the GTA?",
      answer: "A typical elementary school takes 3-4 weeks during summer break. High schools may require 5-6 weeks depending on size. We maximize productivity during vacation periods to ensure schools are ready for students' return."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you handle school board requirements and certifications?",
      answer: "Yes. We're experienced with Ontario school board requirements including background checks, insurance requirements, and safety protocols. All team members undergo necessary clearances for working in Toronto and GTA educational facilities."

  "warehouse-floor-coatings": [
    {
      question: "How durable are epoxy floor coatings for Toronto warehouses?",
      answer: "High-quality epoxy floor coatings last 10-20 years in warehouses with proper application and maintenance. They resist chemicals, heavy traffic, and temperature fluctuations common in GTA warehouses. Regular cleaning extends lifespan significantly."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you apply floor coatings without closing the warehouse?",
      answer: "For large warehouses, we can work in sections to maintain partial operations. However, coatings require 24-48 hours to cure before traffic, so most Mississauga and Toronto clients schedule application during weekends or slower business periods."
    },
    {
      question: "What floor coating system is best for cold storage facilities in Ontario?",
      answer: "Cold storage facilities require specialized polyurea or polyaspartic coatings that cure quickly and resist thermal shock.

  "office-tower-exterior": [
    {
      question: "How do you handle weather delays on high-rise projects in Toronto?",

    },
    {
      question: "What safety measures are required for high-rise exterior work?",
      answer: "Our technicians are certified for rope access and swing staging work. We use fall protection systems, implement ground-level protection zones, coordinate with building management for elevator access, and follow Ontario's strict high-rise safety regulations."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you need to close the building during exterior work?",
