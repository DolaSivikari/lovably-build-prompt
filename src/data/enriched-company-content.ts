  title: 'Our Story',
  content: `Founded in 2009 during the depths of the construction industry recession, Ascent Group Construction was born from a simple observation: building owners needed specialty contractors who could deliver complex envelope restoration work with the technical expertise, quality consistency, and accountability that general contractors couldn't provide through layers of subcontracting.

Our founding team—structural engineers, building envelope specialists, and construction management professionals—recognized that the traditional general contractor model created fundamental problems for envelope work. Multiple subcontractors meant fragmented quality control, schedule conflicts, and finger-pointing when issues arose. Building owners deserved better.

We built Ascent Group differently from day one. Rather than subcontracting work to the lowest bidder, we invested in developing in-house specialty trade capabilities. Our first crew of four EIFS mechanics grew to encompass masonry restoration specialists, structural waterproofing technicians, rope access-certified technicians, and parking garage coating specialists. This vertical integration allowed us to control quality, schedules, and costs while eliminating the subcontractor markup layers that inflated project budgets.

The 2009-2012 period tested our model severely. While competitors struggled with subcontractor defaults and project delays, our self-performed approach thrived. Building owners appreciated our ability to maintain consistent crews, honor commitments, and complete projects on time despite economic uncertainty. By 2013, we had established ourselves as the go-to envelope specialty contractor for property managers and developers who valued reliability over rock-bottom pricing.

Our growth has been deliberate and sustainable. We expanded capabilities methodically—adding parking garage restoration in 2011, emergency response services in 2013, and comprehensive façade remediation programs in 2015. Each expansion built on proven expertise rather than chasing market trends. We invested in specialized equipment (rope access systems, industrial staging, concrete restoration tools) and continuous training rather than maximizing short-term profit.

Today, Ascent Group operates across Ontario with 50+ skilled tradespeople, project managers with P.Eng and PMP credentials, and structural engineering partnerships providing stamped designs and building code compliance. We've completed over 500 envelope restoration projects valued at $2B+ with a 95% on-time completion rate and zero lost-time safety incidents.

What started as a small team of dedicated craftsmen has evolved into Ontario's premier building envelope specialty contractor. But our founding principles remain unchanged: technical expertise over sales promises, quality craftsmanship over lowest price, and long-term client relationships over transactional project execution. When building owners need envelope restoration work done right—on time, within budget, and to the highest quality standards—they call Ascent Group Construction.`,
