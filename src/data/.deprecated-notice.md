# DEPRECATED DATA FILES

⚠️ **IMPORTANT: These JSON files are DEPRECATED and should not be used in new code.**

## Deprecated Files

- `company-info.json` - ❌ DEPRECATED
- `company-credentials.json` - ❌ DEPRECATED

## Why are they deprecated?

All company information, credentials, and settings are now managed through the **database** (site_settings, about_page_settings, footer_settings, contact_page_settings tables). This provides:

1. **Single Source of Truth** - All data comes from one place (database)
2. **Easy Updates** - Admin can update via admin panel without code changes
3. **Consistency** - No more conflicting data across files
4. **Real-time Changes** - Updates appear immediately without redeploy

## What should I use instead?

### For Company Settings (phone, email, address, etc.)

Use the `useCompanySettings` hook:

\`\`\`typescript
import { useCompanySettings } from '@/hooks/useCompanySettings';

const MyComponent = () => {
const { settings } = useCompanySettings();

return (
<div>
<p>Phone: {settings?.phone}</p>
<p>Email: {settings?.email}</p>
<p>Address: {settings?.address}</p>
</div>
);
};
\`\`\`

### For About Page Content (values, sustainability, safety)

Use the `useSettingsData` hook:

\`\`\`typescript
import { useSettingsData } from '@/hooks/useSettingsData';

const MyComponent = () => {
const { data: aboutSettings } = useSettingsData('about_page_settings');

const values = (aboutSettings?.values as any[]) || [];
const sustainabilityData = aboutSettings?.sustainability_commitment;
// etc.
};
\`\`\`

## Database Tables Reference

- **site_settings** - Company name, phone, email, address, business hours, social links
- **about_page_settings** - Company values, sustainability info, safety programs
- **footer_settings** - Footer links and content
- **contact_page_settings** - Contact page specific content

## Migration Status

✅ All data has been migrated to database tables
✅ All components updated to use database hooks
✅ Health check system in place to monitor consistency

## When will these files be deleted?

These files will remain in the codebase for reference purposes but should NOT be imported in any components. They may be permanently deleted in a future cleanup.
